Wieker-Alex-finalproject.ipynb: Newest notebook with updated story telling and deleted commented cells.

Wieker-Alex-finalproject-part3.ipynb: Older notebook that includes commented cells, which were used to create aggregate csv files.


The two datasets that I use for my visualizations were too large to upload to Github, so the files that I am reading into my visualizations are already processed and on GitHub. However, I recognize that users might desire to work with the original files, so I have uploaded them to box.

I would also like users to be aware that sometimes bqplot is finicky and causes errors when interacting with a visualization. If this happens simply re-run the cell.
